## ðŸŒ¤ [Project: Airbnb Hawaii](https://github.com/annechenginc/Airbnb-SQL/blob/main/Airbnb%20Hawaii%20SQL%20Query.sql)
In this query, I use SQL to create a listing of the top 20 Airbnb listings by monthly revenue. I do this by using a subquery table to calculate monthly revenue of each Airbnb listing and converting the data type of price to present it without decimals.
